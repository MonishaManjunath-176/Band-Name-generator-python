# Band-Name-generator-python

This is a simple console-based Python application that generates a fun band name by combining the user's city and pet's name. This project is one of the first exercises in the "100 Days of Code" Python bootcamp, focusing on fundamental concepts.

## Features
* Greets the user and explains the program's purpose.
* Takes two string inputs from the user (city and pet's name).
* Concatenates the two strings to create and display the new band name.

## Technologies Used
* Python 3

## What I Learned
* Basic string manipulation and concatenation.
* Working with user input via the `input()` function.
* Using variables to store and combine data.
* The fundamentals of the `print()` function.
